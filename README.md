# Project3_Group7
Final Project

Requirements:

Identify a problem worth solving or analyzing.
Find a dataset or datasets that are sufficiently large enough to effectively train a ML model or neural network with a high degree of accuracy to ensure that your results are reliable.
Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.
You must use at least two of the following:
- scikit-learn
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Hugging Face
- spaCy or Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- LangChain
- OpenAI

You must use one additional library or technology NOT covered in class, such as:
- Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER)
- Whisper (OpenAI’s automatic speech recognition system)
- DALL·E (OpenAI’s text-to-image model)
- Other OpenAI capabilities, including:
- Text-to-speech
- GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V)
- PyTorch
